Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)Boundary Value Analysis is a black-box testing technique that focuses on testing the boundaries of input values. 
It's based on the idea that errors often occur at the boundaries of acceptable input ranges.
1. Error detection: BVA helps detect errors that occur at the boundaries of input ranges.
2. Efficient testing: By testing boundaries, you can identify potential issues with minimal test cases.

Test Case for BVA:Suppose we have a password field that accepts passwords between 8 to 20 characters long.
Testcase           Description                          Input             Exepected
1                 valid password len min                7char             accepted
2                  valid password len max                20char            accepted
3                   invalid password len below min        17 char           not accepted
4                    invalid password  above max          21 char           not accepted
 (BVA) Advantages:
1. Effective error detection: BVA is particularly effective in detecting errors that occur at the boundaries of input ranges.
2. Efficient testing: By testing boundary values, testers can identify potential issues with minimal test cases.
3. Reduced testing time: BVA helps reduce testing time by focusing on critical boundary values.
4. Improved test coverage: BVA ensures that boundary values are thoroughly tested, reducing the risk of overlooking critical test cases.
5. Simple to apply: BVA is a straightforward technique to apply, making it accessible to testers of various experience levels.

 (BVA) Disadvantages:
1. Limited scope: BVA focuses on boundary values and might not catch errors that occur within the valid range.
2. Difficulty in identifying boundaries: Identifying correct boundaries can be challenging, especially for complex systems or unclear requirements.
3. Not suitable for all systems: BVA might not be effective for systems with non-numeric or non-ordered input data.
4. Dependence on requirements: BVA's effectiveness relies heavily on accurate and complete requirements.
5. Potential for false positives: BVA might identify false positives if the boundaries are not correctly defined or if the system behaves unexpectedly.
